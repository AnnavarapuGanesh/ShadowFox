# 🤖 GPT-2 Text Generation Project (Week 3 - ShadowFox AI/ML Internship)

This project is part of the **ShadowFox Advanced AI/ML Internship (Week 3 Task)**. It involves implementing and analyzing a powerful **language model (GPT-2)** to explore the capabilities of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using text generation techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To explore and demonstrate the functionality of a **pre-trained language model** (GPT-2) through:
- Real-world prompt generation
- Output analysis
- Visualization of results
- Performance benchmarking

---

## 🧠 Why GPT-2?

✅ Open-source and beginner-friendly  
✅ Excellent for generating coherent, creative, and contextual text  
✅ Widely used in research and industry

## 📁 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gpt2_text_generation.py` or `.ipynb` | Main implementation script |
| `README.md` | Project overview and documentation |
| `assets/` | Folder (optional) to store result screenshots or graphs |

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Load and configure GPT-2 model using HuggingFace Transformers
- ✅ Generate text from prompts in multiple domains (creative, education, technical)
- ✅ Visualize response lengths via **matplotlib**
- ✅ Display meaningful insights about GPT-2’s generation style
- ✅ Print a project summary with conclusions and use-case reflections

## 📊 Sample Prompts Used

- *“Once upon a time in Andhra Pradesh…”*  
- *“Explain the importance of Artificial Intelligence in education”*  
- *“What are the benefits of using solar energy in India?”*

## ✅ Conclusion

- GPT-2 is **effective for creative and fluent text generation**.
- Performs well across multiple text domains but may **hallucinate facts**.
- Ideal for **story generation, chatbots, and content writing tools**.
